                  There are many places in Kharkiv where you can have either a
                  quick bracing coffee or a looong relaxing one. Black and white,
                  in beans or instant. Cappuccino, latte, mocca, americano or espresso,
                  with caramel, chocolate or cognac.... Fortunately, the choice is big here!

                <p className="mt-6">
                  First coffee house in Vienna was opened by a Ukrainian,
                  Yuriy Kulchitskiy, in XVI century. At the beginning this
                  drink was not popular in Vienna. But later Yuiry started
                  adding sugar, honey and milk to coffee. The drink became
                  extremely popular, mostly among men, who would come to his
                  coffee house three times a day to read newspapers, discuss
                  recent news and enjoy coffee. Famous &apos;Wiener Melange&apos;
                  was also invented by Kulchitskiy.
